Setup configurations
====================

OIP supports automating the configuration of (parts of) the platform via the management
command ``setup_configuration``. The command uses environment variables to configure OIP
and (by default) automatically tests the configuration to detect problems.


Defining variables
==================

Variables can be defined by creating a ``.env`` file in the root directory of the project
(on the same level as the ``src`` directory, not inside it) and setting the relevant
variables as documented in the sections below, replacing the example values with values
of your choice. Alternatively, you can use a process manager like supervisor or systemd.
For example, both of the following:

::

    # .env
    SITE_WARNING_BANNER_ENABLED=True
    SITE_NAME="My site"

    # systemd config file
    [Service]
    Environment="SITE_WARNING_BANNER_ENABLED=True"
    Environment="SITE_NAME=My site"

will enable the warning banner and define the name of the site as "My site". Note that the
variables are namespaced: ``SITE_FOO=BAR`` for variables concerning the general configuration,
``ZGW_BAR=BAZ`` for variables concerning the configuration of ZGW, and so on. For an overview
of the features that support automatic configuration and the relevant environment variables,
see ``Supported configurations`` below.


Usage
=====

If the project is being configured for the first time, run the command from the project root:

::

    src/manage.py setup_configuration

By default, ``setup_configuration`` checks per configuration step if it is already configured
and skips this step if that is the case. In order to overwrite an existing configuration, use:

::

    src/manage.py setup_configuration --overwrite


Also by default, ``setup_configuration`` tests the configuration to detect problems. You can
disable this with the following:

::

    src/manage.py setup_configuration --no-selftest


For a full overview of the command and its options:

::

    src/manage.py setup_configuration --help
