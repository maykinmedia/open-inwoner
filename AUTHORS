The Open Inwoner project was initiated by Dimpact and i4Sociaal municipalities
to help the residents and to show them what the municipalities can do for them.
Maykin Media team was happy to participate in such a socially significant project.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made the components that 
much better:

    Alex de Landgraaf <alex@maykinmedia.nl>
    Anna Shamray <anna@maykinmedia.nl>
    Jorik Kraaikamp <jorik@maykinmedia.nl>
    Sven van de Scheur <sven@maykinmedia.nl>
    Vasileios Zigras <vasileios@maykinmedia.nl>

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    Dimpact for their active support in creating this application.

    The team and stakeholders for providing valuable business insights and
    ideas: the municipalities of Deventer, Enschede, Groningen, Leeuwarden,
    Zaanstad and Zwolle.
